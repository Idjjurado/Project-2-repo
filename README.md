## Description
Working out sometimes seems like a tasking journey that requires at times some pushing to be excited about! Well with Shonen Strong you can get recommended workout plans that some of your favorite anime characters do to get SHREDDED like a “Saiyan” or maybe a “Pirate King”!

## Usage
You can continue tracking your progress of workouts and goals that you set for yourself based off of "power level" or just see how you stack up against some of your favorite characters from some of your FAVORITE animes! 

An inclusive and fun way to enjoy something we all love to have fun with! Anime is a central part of some of our hobbies and ways to relax, why not integrate it more into some of the more mundane things like working out.

## Project Requirements

**You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:**
- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
- Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
