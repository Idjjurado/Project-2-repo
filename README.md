## Description
Working out sometimes seems like a tasking journey that requires at times some pushing to be excited about! Well with Shonen Strong you can get recommended workout plans that some of your favorite anime characters do to get SHREDDED like a “Saiyan” or maybe a “Pirate King”!

## Usage
You can continue tracking your progress of workouts and goals that you set for yourself based off of "power level" or just see how you stack up against some of your favorite characters from some of your FAVORITE animes! 

An inclusive and fun way to enjoy something we all love to have fun with! Anime is a central part of some of our hobbies and ways to relax, why not integrate it more into some of the more mundane things like working out.
